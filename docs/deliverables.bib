   "This article describes an elegant method of modelling multiple
                  inheritance in C++, without having to explicitly
                  describe the construction of vtables.  Instead,
                  references to objects are accompanied by \emph{paths},
                  allowing one to simultaneously identify the static
                  and dynamic type of an object.\\[1ex]

    The article very carefully lays out the way polymorphic names
                  (those associated with \texttt{virtual} functions)
                  are resolved at run-time, referring to objects'
                  dynamic and static types.  "
